# My Font Collection
My collection of fonts. All fonts should be either True Type or Open Font formats. I've collected a number of various fonts over the years working with Motion Graphics and Graphic design, and I like to have my collection readily available. 

If you are planing on using any of these fonts please check the licensing information for the fonts themselves. A good chunk of these fonts were free to download, and free use, but not all of them. 

## Organization
I didn't find it particularly useful to organize my font collection in any way. The main objective is to be able to quickly install all of these fonts on any system that I want to use for design work, and nothing is really much faster than ``git clone X``. So this is just one folder with a giant collection of fonts in it.
